linch-pin
----------

Linch-pin provides a collection of Ansible playbooks for provisioning and
managing resources across multiple infrastructures. Where multiple
infrastructure resource types can be defined with a single topology file.

Linch-pin can also generate inventory files for use with additional ansible
playbooks. These are applied using an inventory layout file (work in progress).
